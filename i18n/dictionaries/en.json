If you have any questions about the blades, we strongly encourage you to contact us so we can address them. The diagrams below also provide a good summary of the properties. Each color symbolizes the color of the plastic scraper, and the height of the bar shows how much more of that property the blade has compared to the other colors.",

      "title": "Guide",

        "description": "In the demonstration, we see that the Orange scraper blade is soft and flexible. Chris in the video tries to break it but has a very tough time as the blade is so stretchable. This means the blade will adapt more to the surface and bend when it encounters harder resistance."

        "title": "Acrylic Plastic",
        "description": "In the demonstration, we see that the Yellow scraper blade is hard and rigid. Chris in the video breaks it easily as it's not flexible. This means the blade is perfect for flat and hard surfaces like metals, floors, and tables."

      "polycarbonate": {
        "title": "Polycarbonate Blade",
        "description": "In the demonstration, we see that the Blue scraper blade is, compared to the Orange and Yellow blade, right between hardness and softness. This blade is designed for situations where you don't need an overly soft or hard material. In the video, we see that Chris doesn't need to strain too much to break the plastic, but it doesn't give in as easily as the Yellow blade. This means the blade works perfectly on bathtubs, fiberglass, uneven surfaces, and softer metals."

      "industrial": {
        "title": "Industrial Plastic Blade",
        "description": "In the demonstration, we see that the Black plastic blade is very hard but also slightly flexible. This means the blade can handle tough surfaces even in industries that need to take extra effort to scrape away stubborn stains. The blade's properties also mean it maintains its edge much longer and thus has a longer lifespan."

Each blade can potentially be used on any surface, but the solvents or chemicals used to clean the unwanted substance can destroy the blade or the underlying surface. The selection of blade options ensures the right choice to match the surface to be cleaned with the solvent used to remove the unwanted substance."

      "description": "The blades naturally lift dirt up and away without collecting bacteria and can be easily wiped clean with a disposable cloth after each stroke, unlike scrubbing sponges and sponges that collect dirt with each stroke. Scraperite safety scrapers are much better at scraping defined areas, on soft surfaces where metal blades or scrubbing sponges would damage a larger portion of the underlying surface."
